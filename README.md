###Notes from the creator
This twitter clone has a responsive display, that is mobile and desktop friendly. You can toggle the arrow in the header to compose a tweet and it will show up right below, pushing older posts down. If I had more time, I would have liked to add a go to top button which brings the user back up and make the like, retweet and flag buttons, interactive. Add buttons which allow users to edit their avatar and backgrounf. I would have also liked to learn to implement SASS into this project. I hope you enjoy it.
